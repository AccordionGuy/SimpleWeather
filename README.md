This app was written for a multi-part programming tutorial on my tech blog, *[Global Nerdy](http://www.globalnerdy.com/)*. It's a basic weather app that reports the current weather with data from [OpenWeatherMap](http://openweathermap.org) in two different ways:

* It can report the weather for the user's current location
* It can also report the weather for a city name entered by the user

The series of articles that cover this app is called *How to build an iOS weather app in Swift*, and the individual articles are listed below:

* [Part 2: A little more explanation, and turning OpenWeatherMap's JSON into a Swift dictionary](http://www.globalnerdy.com/2016/04/11/how-to-build-an-ios-weather-app-in-swift-part-2-a-little-more-explanation-and-turning-openweathermaps-json-into-a-swift-dictionary/)
